<h1 id="bagelgrid">Bagel Grid</h1>

<p>It&#8217;s designed to be a incredibly easy to use and very customizable mobile-first framework.</p>

<p>Unbelievable customization, change most everything: the number of columns, the gutter size or unit, or even change the names of the classes themselves. Edit the variables in <code>_bagel.scss</code> to make it happen.</p>

<h2 id="quick-startguide">Quick-start guide</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s intended to be mobile first. A column without a prefix will be treated the same no matter how big or small.
<code>
&lt;div class=&quot;col col--1-of-4&quot;&gt;
  A half column on a small screen size
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></p>

<p>If you want the column to be treated differently at different screen widths just include different classes to represent them.
<code>
&lt;div class=&quot;col col--1-of-2 col--m-1-of-4 col--l-2-of-12&quot;&gt;
  A half column in a small screen size,
  a quarter column in a medium screen size,
  and two twelfths in a large screen size
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></p>

<h2 id="customizing">Customizing</h2>

<p><code>$bagel-grid-namespace</code>, <code>$bagel-grid-column-namespace</code>, and <code>$bagel-wrapper-namespace</code> adjusts the class names for the grid. With default values, grid wrappers have a class of <code>.grid</code>, columns <code>.col</code>, and the wrapper <code>.bagel_wrapper</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>.bagel_wrapper</code> is Bagel&#8217;s solution to maintaining a consistent page width for different devices. Changing the breakpoint changes not only which column classes take effect but also which wrapper size is used. You can choose to change everything about the wrapper or if the wrapper is included in the exported CSS at all!</p>

<p><code>$bagel-small-custom-grid</code>, <code>$bagel-medium-custom-grid</code>, and <code>$bagel-large-custom-grid</code> allow you to choose whether or not you want the only the default grid sizes or if you also want custom grids for those sizes as well. Simply mark them as true if you wish to have custom grids at those sizes.</p>

<h6 id="note:bydefaultthecolumnsizesincludedare123and4">note: By default, the column sizes included are 1, 2, 3, and 4</h6>

<p><code>$bagel-col-groups(n)</code> adjusts column divisions. For example, <code>$bagel-col-groups(12)</code> will produce a 12-column grid. <code>$toast-col-groups(3,6,8)</code> will produce a 3-, 6-, and 8-column grids for all the custom grid sizes marked true on the previous step.</p>

<h6 id="note:asofnowyoucanonlychoosewhetherornotcustomgridsareenabledatdifferentscreensizes.youcannothavedifferentcustomgridsfordifferentsizes.">note: As of now you can only choose whether or not custom grids are enabled at different screen sizes. You cannot have different custom grids for different sizes.</h6>

<p><code>$bagel-gutter-width</code> is just that. It&#8217;ll accept any unit.</p>

<h6 id="note:ifyouchoosetousepercentageandintendtousethepushandpullsmakesuretohavebagel-gutter-using-percentmarkedastrue.">note: if you choose to use percentage and intend to use the push and pulls make sure to have <code>$bagel-gutter-using-percent</code> marked as <code>true</code>.</h6>

<p><code>$bagel-breakpoint-medium</code> and <code>$toast-breakpoint-small</code> are breakpoint placeholders. Columns and the bagel wrapper have hooks to change their behavior under these breakpoints.</p>

<h2 id="extras">Extras</h2>

<p>Bagel has some extra modifiers to make different kinds of layouts easier. Most of them are borrowed completely from the Toast Framework and aren&#8217;t fully tested yet.</p>

<h6 id="note:thepushandpullforgutterunitsseemsfullyfunctionalatthistime.">note: the push and pull for % gutter units seems fully functional at this time.</h6>

<h5 id="notcompilingifyourenotusingthepercentageunitintheguttersmakesurethattheoptionbelowthegutterismarkedasfalse.thepushesandpullsarealittlefunky.thepercentversionofpushesandpullsworkalittledifferentlybecauseofmaththatcantbedoneinconjunctionwithanyothertype">Not compiling? If you&#8217;re not using the percentage unit in the gutters make sure that the option below the gutter is marked as <code>false</code>. The pushes and pulls are a little funky. The percent version of pushes and pulls work a little differently because of math that can&#8217;t be done in conjunction with any other type</h5>

<p>That just about does it. Enjoy!</p>
